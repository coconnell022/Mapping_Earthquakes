# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating interactive maps using Mapbox API and JavaScript

The purpose of this project was to create interactive maps to showcase earthquake data throughout the world using Mapbox API and JavaScript. The website shows a visualization that displays earthquake data on earth in relation to tectonic plate data and highlights all major earthquakes within the past week. There are 3 types of maps available: street, satellite, and a light version. The maps also show the earthquakes using circle symbols with a legend on the bottom to represent difference in magnitude and a dark red line to show locations of tectonic plates.
